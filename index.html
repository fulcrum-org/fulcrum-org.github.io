<p><em>Fulcrum is organizing people</em> to maximize positive impact.</p>

<p>What do we want people to get out of the Fulcrum Wiki?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Where did we come from? What is the world like today and how did it get like that?</li>
  <li>What’s our best prediction about the future? What’s the timeline?</li>
  <li>What things about that prediction do we like and want to happen? What can we do to build it or make it happen faster?</li>
  <li>What worries us about the future? What predictions do we want to avoid? What can we do to avoid the predictions we don’t like?</li>
  <li>What is the Impact Economy?</li>
  <li>What are all the Grand Challenges we’ve identified so far?</li>
  <li>What can I do to become an effective founder of an exponential organization and tackle some of these grand challenges?</li>
  <li>I don’t want to found a tech company! What can I do to help?</li>
</ul>

<p>We are currently working on a curriculum to make you a bona fide futurist and innovator.</p>

<p>And guess what? No minimum requirements. As long as you can understand English, you should be able to learn from our material.</p>

<p>In the meantime, here’s a rough outline and some third party resources to get you started. (It’s what we’ve personally read and what we’re basing our informational content on.)</p>
