# Getting Started

_Fulcrum is organizing people_ to maximize positive impact.

What do we want people to get out of the Fulcrum Wiki?
* Where did we come from? What is the world like today and how did it get like that?
* What’s our best prediction about the future? What’s the timeline?
* What things about that prediction do we like and want to happen? What can we do to build it or make it happen faster?
* What worries us about the future? What predictions do we want to avoid? What can we do to avoid the predictions we don’t like?
* What is the Impact Economy?
* What are all the Grand Challenges we’ve identified so far?
* What can I do to become an effective founder of an exponential organization and tackle some of these grand challenges?
* I don't want to found a tech company! What can I do to help?

We are currently working on a curriculum to make you a bona fide futurist and innovator.

And guess what? No minimum requirements. As long as you can understand English, you should be able to learn from our material.

In the meantime, here's a rough outline and some third party resources to get you started. (It's what we've personally read and what we're basing our informational content on.)
